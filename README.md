## What Tuttle Does

Tuttle is a desktop app that takes the paperwork off your plate as a freelancer:

- **Track your time** — import it from your calendar or from your time-tracking tool.
- **Generate invoices and timesheets** — automatically from your tracked time, or by entering hours and days manually, then export to PDF and send by email.
- **See your business at a glance** — a dashboard with revenue, outstanding invoices, project budgets, and key performance indicators.
- **Keep your data private** — everything is processed and stored locally on your device, with no central data collection.

## Mission Statement

The working world is changing, the trend is towards freelancing: software developers, designers and journalists appreciate the freedom and creative possibilities of solo self-employment. More and more professionals are choosing it for themselves. It allows them to specialize and gain experience with many projects and clients.

With freelancing, there are many side activities: Marketing, client communication, legal and financial planning - although the latter probably appeals to few solo self-employed people. But what if software could make financial planning in freelancing almost as easy as being an employee? Our tool minimizes risks and makes the financial part of the job easy. Freelancing becomes more efficient, less risky, and therefore more beginner-friendly.

With Tuttle, we are developing a financial planning tool that is tailored to the needs of solo freelancers. We automate and give freelancers more time to do the work they love.
The application provides analysis and forecasting functions on income, expenses, disposable income, uncertainty management or explainability of the forecast and convinces with portability, among other things.

We develop the solution as a desktop application. Sensitive financial data is processed locally on the end device without central data collection. For data analysis, we rely on open source tools from the Python ecosystem. We are consciously developing a desktop app with local data storage, not a web app, since your business data is none of our business.

### Invoicing

Generate invoices and timesheets automatically from your time tracking data, or create invoices manually by entering the quantity of hours or days directly. Export to PDF and send via email.

Invoices are generated as **Factur-X / ZUGFeRD** electronic invoices by default: machine-readable XML (EN16931) is embedded directly into the PDF, compliant with EU e-invoicing requirements without changing your workflow.
