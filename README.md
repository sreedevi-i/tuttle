## Mission Statement

The working world is changing, the trend is towards freelancing: software developers, designers and journalists appreciate the freedom and creative possibilities of solo self-employment. More and more professionals are choosing it for themselves. It allows them to specialize and gain experience with many projects and clients.

With freelancing, there are many side activities: Marketing, client communication, legal and financial planning - although the latter probably appeals to few solo self-employed people. But what if software could make financial planning in freelancing almost as easy as being an employee? Our tool minimizes risks and makes the financial part of the job easy. Freelancing becomes more efficient, less risky, and therefore more beginner-friendly.

With Tuttle, we are developing a financial planning tool that is tailored to the needs of solo freelancers. We automate and give freelancers more time to do the work they love.
The application provides analysis and forecasting functions on income, expenses, disposable income, uncertainty management or explainability of the forecast and convinces with portability, among other things.

We develop the solution as a desktop application. Sensitive financial data is processed locally on the end device without central data collection. For data analysis, we rely on open source tools from the Python ecosystem. We are consciously developing a desktop app with local data storage, not a web app, since your business data is none of our business.


## Features

## Architecture

Tuttle is a desktop application with a Python core and an Electron UI shell.

- **Python core** (`tuttle/`): Business logic, data models, invoicing, tax calculations, and a JSON-RPC server (`tuttle/rpc_server.py`) that exposes the core as a stdio service.
- **Electron shell** (`ui/`): React + TypeScript desktop UI that communicates with the Python core via JSON-RPC over stdio.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or newer
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip
- Node.js 22 or newer

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tuttle-dev/tuttle.git
cd tuttle
```

2. Install Python dependencies:

```shell
uv sync
```

3. Install Electron dependencies:

```shell
cd ui
npm install
```

### Running the App (Development)

```shell
cd ui
npm run dev
```

This starts the Electron app in development mode. The Python RPC sidecar is spawned automatically.

### Building for Production

```shell
just build
```

This builds the Python sidecar with PyInstaller and packages the Electron app with electron-builder.

### Running the Tests

```shell
uv run pytest
```
